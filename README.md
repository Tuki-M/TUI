## Exercise 3 >
You will see that in the tag 1 to 6 i used the approach of having a method name with optional arguments with default values to handle the backward compatibility with the older version of the "library" 
but in the tag 7 to 9 i used another approach by creating a new method for each new user story from the business team

I think that we can use the first approach if it's not a big evolution otherwise i prefer the second approach because we will have less risk of regressions issues
