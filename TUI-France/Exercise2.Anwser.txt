2.How would you rate the quality of the piece of code ?

> The checks using 'is' operator are useless regarding the fact that after the check we use 'as' operator to cast and in my opinion
  the 'as' internally uses the 'is' operator and if false it returns <null>, 'is' operator is quick but why add unnecessary step ? 

We can simply write something like this : 

  var messageA = message as MessageA;
  var messageB = message as MessageB;
  var messageC = message as MessageC;

  if(messageA != null){
	messageA.MyCustomMthodOnA();
  }
  else if(messageB != null){
	messageB.MyCustomMthodOnB();
	messageB.SomeAdditionalMthodOnB();
  }
  else if(messageC != null){
	messageC.MyCustomMthodOnC();
  }
  else{
	//We have always to handle the 'else', even just to make a trace in logs 
  }
